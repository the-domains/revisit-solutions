You love Xero. There are plenty of add-ons. In an increasingly digital business-scape, finding the best tools for your business and having them play well together is increasingly important.

Chances are you have a CRM. 

Chances are better that you have an email marketing tool that integrates with your CRM like MailChimp, ConstantContact, AWeber or something.

And maybe that CRM does a reasonable job of sales pipeline management & opportunity forecasting as well.

Guessing that you also have a workflow tool that manages your production, whether that be a manufacturing system, project management system, job/time management system .... and of course it talks to Xero.

If you've already got all this set up then I imagine you have some sort of dashboard tool that pulls required data / reports together from all these systems in one snazzy view.

So how's it working for you? Do they all play well together? How much of your business process did you have to change to fit the various software? And what do all those subscriptions cost you each month?

Does your CRM know who's clicking on what links in your emails? Does your CRM track where people are hearing about you? 

Do you know your site visitor to CRM contact numbers?

Do you know how many contacts in your CRM become customers? And how much they spend? And how regularly? And where they came from?

So how do you know where to spend your marketing / advertising budget?

In taking your business digital, there's no more powerful combination in our opinion, than Infusionsoft and Xero as an end-to-end BI, marketing and workflow automation tool.

Knowing where your leads came from, how they're engaging with your marketing, who became a customer and how much they spent; and where you're better off spending your advertising budget to attract more like customers has got to be a good thing, right?
